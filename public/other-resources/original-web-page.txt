Some notes on the included original-web-page.HTML

The related html file contains the rendered content of the original
Aviary web page, previously located at "http://www.ubc-voc.com/aviary".
This site is generated by Wordpress using a custom plugin and theme
created by VOCers of years past.

I've added comments to the file where appropriate to help make sense
of some more obscure parts of the document. Notably, the Twitter
window (previously used to generate a live update of recent check-ins)
and the Google Calendar iFrame (previously used to display our ever-
changing schedule to the public).
