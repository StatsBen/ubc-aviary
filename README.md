## Introduction

The Aviary is a roped climbing gym at UBC. Originally built in 2014,
it was managed by the Varsity Outdoor Club until a new club called
The Aviary was founded in 2017 to take over the increasing
responsibilities of managing it.

The Aviary's website is built to provide info about the gym to the
public, and to facilitate some online tasks like waiver signing and
bookings that would otherwise be very time consuming for monitors.

If you're the new Communications Coordinator, congratulations!
Hopefully this guide can answer any questions you may have about the
website, but if it doesn't please feel free to email myself (Ben Clark
email above). If I can't answer your question, contact Corey Kelly.
He generally knows everything about the Aviary always.

## Editing The Sourcecode

### Development Environment
This website comprises mostly HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. I
personally love the open source IDE 'Atom' with all the community
supported packages, but of course you're welcome to use whatever
you'd like.
